# Height_Weight_Prediction
# Description: 
 This project explores the use of machine learning techniques for predicting height based on age. This Model is all about exploring and modeling the relationship between 
 height and age. This model can be used to predict the approximate height of a person based on their age. It provides a basic view on how to perform data exploration, 
 modeling, and evaluation tasks using Python libraries and provides a basic understanding of linear and polynomial regression for prediction tasks. However, it's important to 
 note that this prediction will not be perfect because many factors influence height it's used to understand how age might influence height and potentially predict heights 
 based on age.

# Working
1.Load and explore a dataset.

2.Visualize the relationship between age and height.
 
3.Split the data into training and testing sets.

4.Implement linear regression to predict height based on age.

5.Evaluate the model's performance.

6.Explore polynomial regression as a more accurate approach.

7.Train and evaluate the polynomial regression model.

8.Visualize the actual heights compared to predictions from both models.
